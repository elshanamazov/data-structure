# Data-structures

Based on **TypeScript**, this project aims to explore and implement various **data structures and algorithms**. The project uses a modern stack of technologies and tools to develop, test and maintain code quality. Here are some key aspects of the project:

- **Commitizen** and **Commitlint**: Used to enforce commit conventions.
- **Bun**: This is a modern tool that provides fast test execution and an efficient development environment.
- **ESLint** and **Prettier**: Provide static code analysis and automatic formatting.
- **TypeScript**: Is the backbone of the project, providing typing during development.
- **Husky** and **Lint-staged**: Used to automate linting and other code quality checks before committing.
